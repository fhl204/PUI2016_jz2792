#Citibike Review:

a) The reviewer proposes to test whether one-time Citibike users have longer trip duration than subscribers.
  The null and alternate hypothesis were developed to be tested mathematically.  The testable hypothesis compares
  the mean of trip duration of the two groups complete with formula representations and a significance level of p=0.05.

b) The dataset was properly prepared to pull trip durations and usertypes (i.e. subscriber).  The research assumes that 
  non-subscribers are single users.  A graph was generated to present the average trip duration of the two groups.

c) The independent variable is usertype, which is categorical (subscriber or customer).  The dependent variable for this 
  analysis is trip duration which is continous measured in seconds.  There are no control variables.   Given these parameters,
  ANOVA statistical analysis would be appropriate to test the null hypothesis.
